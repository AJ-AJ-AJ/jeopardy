## Project Description

For project #1, I created a simple game of Tic Tac Toe.

Once players come to the site, they are asked to input their names. The first player starts by placing a 'X' in a square. They then alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either player has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. Once a player wins, their score increases. When there is a tie, the score increases for tie games. The game allows players to play multiple games and reset the score.
