## Project Description

The goal of this project was to create a game that would allow the user to play a game of Jeopardy. This is a quiz game where the user gets to choose a question from a variety of topics while choosing a dollar amount ($200 to $1000) to attempt to win. The questions are phrased as answers and the user inputs a question to attempt to win.
